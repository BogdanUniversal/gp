The classical Pareto distribution can be\n        obtained from the Lomax distribution by adding 1 and\n        multiplying by the scale parameter ``m`` (see Notes).  The\n        smallest value of the Lomax distribution is zero while for the\n        classical Pareto distribution it is ``mu``, where the standard\n        Pareto distribution has location ``mu = 1``.  Lomax can also\n        be considered as a simplified version of the Generalized\n        Pareto distribution (available in SciPy), with the scale set\n        to one and the location set to zero.\n\n        The Pareto distribution must be greater than zero, and is\n        unbounded above.  It is also known as the \"80-20 rule\".  In\n        this distribution, 80 percent of the weights are in the lowest\n        20 percent of the range, while the other 20 percent fill the\n        remaining 80 percent of the range.\n\n        .. note::\n            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.pareto`\n            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;\n            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        a : float or array_like of floats\n            Shape of the distribution.

Outside the field of\n        economics it is generally referred to as the Bradford\n        distribution. Pareto developed the distribution to describe\n        the distribution of wealth in an economy.  It has also found\n        use in insurance, web page access statistics, oil field sizes,\n        and many other problems, including the download frequency for\n        projects in Sourceforge [1]_.

The classical Pareto distribution can be\n        obtained from the Lomax distribution by adding 1 and\n        multiplying by the scale parameter ``m`` (see Notes).  The\n        smallest value of the Lomax distribution is zero while for the\n        classical Pareto distribution it is ``mu``, where the standard\n        Pareto distribution has location ``mu = 1``.  Lomax can also\n        be considered as a simplified version of the Generalized\n        Pareto distribution (available in SciPy), with the scale set\n        to one and the location set to zero.\n\n        The Pareto distribution must be greater than zero, and is\n        unbounded above.  It is also known as the \"80-20 rule\".  In\n        this distribution, 80 percent of the weights are in the lowest\n        20 percent of the range, while the other 20 percent fill the\n        remaining 80 percent of the range.\n\n        .. note::\n            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.pareto`\n            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;\n            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        a : float or array_like of floats\n            Shape of the distribution.

Outside the field of\n        economics it is generally referred to as the Bradford\n        distribution. Pareto developed the distribution to describe\n        the distribution of wealth in an economy.  It has also found\n        use in insurance, web page access statistics, oil field sizes,\n        and many other problems, including the download frequency for\n        projects in Sourceforge [1]_.  It is one of the so-called\n        \"fat-tailed\" distributions.\n\n        References\n        ----------\n        ..
