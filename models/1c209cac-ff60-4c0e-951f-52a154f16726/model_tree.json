The classical Pareto distribution can be\n        obtained from the Lomax distribution by adding 1 and\n        multiplying by the scale parameter ``m`` (see Notes).  The\n        smallest value of the Lomax distribution is zero while for the\n        classical Pareto distribution it is ``mu``, where the standard\n        Pareto distribution has location ``mu = 1``.  Lomax can also\n        be considered as a simplified version of the Generalized\n        Pareto distribution (available in SciPy), with the scale set\n        to one and the location set to zero.\n\n        The Pareto distribution must be greater than zero, and is\n        unbounded above.  It is also known as the \"80-20 rule\".  In\n        this distribution, 80 percent of the weights are in the lowest\n        20 percent of the range, while the other 20 percent fill the\n        remaining 80 percent of the range.\n\n        .. note::\n            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.pareto`\n            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;\n            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        a : float or array_like of floats\n            Shape of the distribution.

Outside the field of\n        economics it is generally referred to as the Bradford\n        distribution. Pareto developed the distribution to describe\n        the distribution of wealth in an economy.  It has also found\n        use in insurance, web page access statistics, oil field sizes,\n        and many other problems, including the download frequency for\n        projects in Sourceforge [1]_.

Some references claim that the Wald is an inverse Gaussian\n        with mean equal to 1, but this is by no means universal.\n\n        The inverse Gaussian distribution was first studied in relationship to\n        Brownian motion. In 1956 M.C.K. Tweedie used the name inverse Gaussian\n        because there is an inverse relationship between the time to cover a\n        unit distance and distance covered in unit time.\n\n        .. note::\n            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.wald`\n            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;\n            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        mean : float or array_like of floats\n            Distribution mean, must be > 0.\n        scale : float or array_like of floats\n            Scale parameter, must be > 0.\n        size : int or tuple of ints, optional\n            Output shape.

The square of the standard deviation, :math:`\\sigma^2`,\n        is called the variance.\n\n        The function has its peak at the mean, and its \"spread\" increases with\n        the standard deviation (the function reaches 0.607 times its maximum at\n        :math:`x + \\sigma` and :math:`x - \\sigma` [2]_).

For example, it\n        describes the commonly occurring distribution of samples influenced\n        by a large number of tiny, random disturbances, each with its own\n        unique distribution [2]_.\n\n        .. note::\n            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.normal`\n            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;\n            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        loc : float or array_like of floats\n            Mean (\"centre\") of the distribution.\n        scale : float or array_like of floats\n            Standard deviation (spread or \"width\") of the distribution. Must be\n            non-negative.\n        size : int or tuple of ints, optional\n            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then\n            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),\n            a single value is returned if ``loc`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.\n            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(loc, scale).size`` samples are drawn.\n\n        Returns\n        -------\n        out : ndarray or scalar\n            Drawn samples from the parameterized normal distribution.\n\n        See Also\n        --------\n        scipy.stats.norm : probability density function, distribution or\n            cumulative density function, etc.\n        random.Generator.normal: which should be used for new code.\n\n        Notes\n        -----\n        The probability density for the Gaussian distribution is\n\n        .. math:: p(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{ 2 \\pi \\sigma^2 }}\n                         e^{ - \\frac{ (x - \\mu)^2 } {2 \\sigma^2} },\n\n        where :math:`\\mu` is the mean and :math:`\\sigma` the standard\n        deviation. The square of the standard deviation, :math:`\\sigma^2`,\n        is called the variance.\n\n        The function has its peak at the mean, and its \"spread\" increases with\n        the standard deviation (the function reaches 0.607 times its maximum at\n        :math:`x + \\sigma` and :math:`x - \\sigma` [2]_).  This implies that\n        normal is more likely to return samples lying close to the mean, rather\n        than those far away.\n\n        References\n        ----------\n        ..

The classical Pareto distribution can be\n        obtained from the Lomax distribution by adding 1 and\n        multiplying by the scale parameter ``m`` (see Notes).  The\n        smallest value of the Lomax distribution is zero while for the\n        classical Pareto distribution it is ``mu``, where the standard\n        Pareto distribution has location ``mu = 1``.  Lomax can also\n        be considered as a simplified version of the Generalized\n        Pareto distribution (available in SciPy), with the scale set\n        to one and the location set to zero.\n\n        The Pareto distribution must be greater than zero, and is\n        unbounded above.  It is also known as the \"80-20 rule\".  In\n        this distribution, 80 percent of the weights are in the lowest\n        20 percent of the range, while the other 20 percent fill the\n        remaining 80 percent of the range.\n\n        .. note::\n            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.pareto`\n            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;\n            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        a : float or array_like of floats\n            Shape of the distribution.

If size is ``None`` (default),\n            a single value is returned if ``a`` is a scalar.  Otherwise,\n            ``np.array(a).size`` samples are drawn.\n\n        Returns\n        -------\n        out : ndarray or scalar\n            Drawn samples from the parameterized Pareto distribution.\n\n        See Also\n        --------\n        scipy.stats.lomax : probability density function, distribution or\n            cumulative density function, etc.\n        scipy.stats.genpareto : probability density function, distribution or\n            cumulative density function, etc.\n        random.Generator.pareto: which should be used for new code.\n\n        Notes\n        -----\n        The probability density for the Pareto distribution is\n\n        .. math:: p(x) = \\frac{am^a}{x^{a+1}}\n\n        where :math:`a` is the shape and :math:`m` the scale.\n\n        The Pareto distribution, named after the Italian economist\n        Vilfredo Pareto, is a power law probability distribution\n        useful in many real world problems.  Outside the field of\n        economics it is generally referred to as the Bradford\n        distribution. Pareto developed the distribution to describe\n        the distribution of wealth in an economy.  It has also found\n        use in insurance, web page access statistics, oil field sizes,\n        and many other problems, including the download frequency for\n        projects in Sourceforge [1]_.  It is one of the so-called\n        \"fat-tailed\" distributions.\n\n        References\n        ----------\n        ..

Some references claim that the Wald is an inverse Gaussian\n        with mean equal to 1, but this is by no means universal.\n\n        The inverse Gaussian distribution was first studied in relationship to\n        Brownian motion. In 1956 M.C.K. Tweedie used the name inverse Gaussian\n        because there is an inverse relationship between the time to cover a\n        unit distance and distance covered in unit time.\n\n        .. note::\n            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.wald`\n            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;\n            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        mean : float or array_like of floats\n            Distribution mean, must be > 0.\n        scale : float or array_like of floats\n            Scale parameter, must be > 0.\n        size : int or tuple of ints, optional\n            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then\n            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),\n            a single value is returned if ``mean`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.\n            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(mean, scale).size`` samples are drawn.\n\n        Returns\n        -------\n        out : ndarray or scalar\n            Drawn samples from the parameterized Wald distribution.\n\n        See Also\n        --------\n        random.Generator.wald: which should be used for new code.\n\n        Notes\n        -----\n        The probability density function for the Wald distribution is\n\n        .. math:: P(x;mean,scale) = \\sqrt{\\frac{scale}{2\\pi x^3}}e^\n                                    \\frac{-scale(x-mean)^2}{2\\cdotp mean^2x}\n\n        As noted above the inverse Gaussian distribution first arise\n        from attempts to model Brownian motion. It is also a\n        competitor to the Weibull for use in reliability modeling and\n        modeling stock returns and interest rate processes.\n\n        References\n        ----------\n        ..

The classical Pareto distribution can be\n        obtained from the Lomax distribution by adding 1 and\n        multiplying by the scale parameter ``m`` (see Notes).  The\n        smallest value of the Lomax distribution is zero while for the\n        classical Pareto distribution it is ``mu``, where the standard\n        Pareto distribution has location ``mu = 1``.  Lomax can also\n        be considered as a simplified version of the Generalized\n        Pareto distribution (available in SciPy), with the scale set\n        to one and the location set to zero.\n\n        The Pareto distribution must be greater than zero, and is\n        unbounded above.  It is also known as the \"80-20 rule\".  In\n        this distribution, 80 percent of the weights are in the lowest\n        20 percent of the range, while the other 20 percent fill the\n        remaining 80 percent of the range.\n\n        .. note::\n            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.pareto`\n            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;\n            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        a : float or array_like of floats\n            Shape of the distribution.

Outside the field of\n        economics it is generally referred to as the Bradford\n        distribution. Pareto developed the distribution to describe\n        the distribution of wealth in an economy.  It has also found\n        use in insurance, web page access statistics, oil field sizes,\n        and many other problems, including the download frequency for\n        projects in Sourceforge [1]_.  It is one of the so-called\n        \"fat-tailed\" distributions.\n\n        References\n        ----------\n        ..

Some references claim that the Wald is an inverse Gaussian\n        with mean equal to 1, but this is by no means universal.\n\n        The inverse Gaussian distribution was first studied in relationship to\n        Brownian motion. In 1956 M.C.K. Tweedie used the name inverse Gaussian\n        because there is an inverse relationship between the time to cover a\n        unit distance and distance covered in unit time.\n\n        .. note::\n            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.wald`\n            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;\n            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        mean : float or array_like of floats\n            Distribution mean, must be > 0.\n        scale : float or array_like of floats\n            Scale parameter, must be > 0.\n        size : int or tuple of ints, optional\n            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then\n            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),\n            a single value is returned if ``mean`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.\n            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(mean, scale).size`` samples are drawn.\n\n        Returns\n        -------\n        out : ndarray or scalar\n            Drawn samples from the parameterized Wald distribution.\n\n        See Also\n        --------\n        random.Generator.wald: which should be used for new code.\n\n        Notes\n        -----\n        The probability density function for the Wald distribution is\n\n        .. math:: P(x;mean,scale) = \\sqrt{\\frac{scale}{2\\pi x^3}}e^\n                                    \\frac{-scale(x-mean)^2}{2\\cdotp mean^2x}\n\n        As noted above the inverse Gaussian distribution first arise\n        from attempts to model Brownian motion. It is also a\n        competitor to the Weibull for use in reliability modeling and\n        modeling stock returns and interest rate processes.\n\n        References\n        ----------\n        ..

Some references claim that the Wald is an inverse Gaussian\n        with mean equal to 1, but this is by no means universal.\n\n        The inverse Gaussian distribution was first studied in relationship to\n        Brownian motion. In 1956 M.C.K. Tweedie used the name inverse Gaussian\n        because there is an inverse relationship between the time to cover a\n        unit distance and distance covered in unit time.\n\n        .. note::\n            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.wald`\n            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;\n            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        mean : float or array_like of floats\n            Distribution mean, must be > 0.\n        scale : float or array_like of floats\n            Scale parameter, must be > 0.\n        size : int or tuple of ints, optional\n            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then\n            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),\n            a single value is returned if ``mean`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.\n            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(mean, scale).size`` samples are drawn.\n\n        Returns\n        -------\n        out : ndarray or scalar\n            Drawn samples from the parameterized Wald distribution.\n\n        See Also\n        --------\n        random.Generator.wald: which should be used for new code.\n\n        Notes\n        -----\n        The probability density function for the Wald distribution is\n\n        .. math:: P(x;mean,scale) = \\sqrt{\\frac{scale}{2\\pi x^3}}e^\n                                    \\frac{-scale(x-mean)^2}{2\\cdotp mean^2x}\n\n        As noted above the inverse Gaussian distribution first arise\n        from attempts to model Brownian motion. It is also a\n        competitor to the Weibull for use in reliability modeling and\n        modeling stock returns and interest rate processes.\n\n        References\n        ----------\n        ..
