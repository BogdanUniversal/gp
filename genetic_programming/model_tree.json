For example, it\n        describes the commonly occurring distribution of samples influenced\n        by a large number of tiny, random disturbances, each with its own\n        unique distribution [2]_.\n\n        .. note::\n            New code should use the `~numpy.random.Generator.normal`\n            method of a `~numpy.random.Generator` instance instead;\n            please see the :ref:`random-quick-start`.\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        loc : float or array_like of floats\n            Mean (\"centre\") of the distribution.\n        scale : float or array_like of floats\n            Standard deviation (spread or \"width\") of the distribution. Must be\n            non-negative.\n        size : int or tuple of ints, optional\n            Output shape.  If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then\n            ``m * n * k`` samples are drawn.  If size is ``None`` (default),\n            a single value is returned if ``loc`` and ``scale`` are both scalars.\n            Otherwise, ``np.broadcast(loc, scale).size`` samples are drawn.\n\n        Returns\n        -------\n        out : ndarray or scalar\n            Drawn samples from the parameterized normal distribution.\n\n        See Also\n        --------\n        scipy.stats.norm : probability density function, distribution or\n            cumulative density function, etc.\n        random.Generator.normal: which should be used for new code.\n\n        Notes\n        -----\n        The probability density for the Gaussian distribution is\n\n        .. math:: p(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{ 2 \\pi \\sigma^2 }}\n                         e^{ - \\frac{ (x - \\mu)^2 } {2 \\sigma^2} },\n\n        where :math:`\\mu` is the mean and :math:`\\sigma` the standard\n        deviation. The square of the standard deviation, :math:`\\sigma^2`,\n        is called the variance.\n\n        The function has its peak at the mean, and its \"spread\" increases with\n        the standard deviation (the function reaches 0.607 times its maximum at\n        :math:`x + \\sigma` and :math:`x - \\sigma` [2]_).  This implies that\n        normal is more likely to return samples lying close to the mean, rather\n        than those far away.\n\n        References\n        ----------\n        ..
